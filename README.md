A listEvent with links for every day of Arthur Schnitzlerâ€™s adult life

This repository collects links to different biographical sources on Arthur Schnitzler. The general idea is to be able to look up any given day in his life and get a listing of his diary entry, letters and manuscripts from that very day.

The basic table contents include:

projectname
iso-date
written-date*
from*
to*
title
URL

* are not mandatory. if @from and @to are given "iso-date" can be omitted.

if the URL is mandatory is not clear yet. most likely yes
